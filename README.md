# Illusions Graph Database
Data for graph-based illusion database

## Visualization

https://graphcommons.com/graphs/b5eec0ec-8ac5-4237-9b9f-d8457cc27b85

## Why?

A graphical database is so much easier to search. It is also great to see which illusions are related, which are mixing several effects, and whether some illusions have not been created yet. But there are so many illusions out there.... this needs to be a community effort. Help us out!

## Contribute!

### Edit using graph UI

Download the csv files from this repository and import them to https://graphcommons.com/
Modify the graph.
Export the new csv files -- nodes and edges.
Create a pull request to this repository and I'll merge it!

### Edit csv directly

I wouldn't recommend it as you risk breaking the formatting or forgetting to add some properties, but you can always give it a try.
