Munker Illusion,The Dress,"From Wikipedia:

The dress is a photograph that became a viral phenomenon on the Internet in 2015. Viewers of the image disagreed on whether the dress depicted was coloured black and blue, or white and gold. The phenomenon revealed differences in human colour perception, which have been the subject of ongoing scientific investigations into neuroscience and vision science, producing a number of papers published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.",https://images2.imgbox.com/f0/7f/clAcUcyg_o.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress,,2015,Cecilia Bleasdale,,,,
Hermann grid,Hermann grid,"The Hermann grid illusion is an optical illusion reported by Ludimar Hermann in 1870.[1] The illusion is characterized by ""ghostlike"" grey blobs perceived at the intersections of a white (or light-colored) grid on a black background.

Phantom Curved Lines,Cobbles,"From the author's page:

So yes, I really made that optical illusion….
…..And no- there’s no curved lines!

I liked his watermark better than the one i used in my Patreon post. I struggle with watermarking my work (obviously!)

I posted it publicly on Facebook before anywhere else, but left my name off. After all, I illustrate totally different things for a living, I thought it was just “cool looking” so I threw it up there on a lark.

Sorta the same thing on Reddit.

Short of a giant watermark in the middle it’s hard to keep my name attached, so if you see anyone else claiming credit, please consider letting me know. Im a disabled artist who side gigs my way the the work day- it would be great to have ownership of my wirk.

If you’re dubious I have all the original files including video of the “tile” being made.

I’m happy to answer questions and yes, there are more coming!

And now you can get everything from a jigsaw puzzle to a poster on Redbubble:

Munker Illusion,Confetti illusion,"The Munker illusion, which produces two apparently different hues from a base color, can be extended to multiple apparent colors. By having foreground stripes in more than two colors, it is possible to create multiple foreground colors that lead to multiple apparent hues in the base objects. This technique works well for three colors and can be extended to four, six, and even ten colors.",https://images2.imgbox.com/18/60/vGTUQ6Tz_o.jpg,https://journalofillusion.net/index.php/joi/article/view/6152/13749,,2021,"David Novick, Akiyoshi Kitaoka","Journal of Illusion 2021, 2: 6152 - https://doi.org/10.47691/joi.v2.6152",,,
